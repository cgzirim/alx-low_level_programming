0x0A. C - argc, argv
#

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{

  return 0;
}

The name of the variable argc stands for "argument count"; argc contains the number of arguments passed to the program. The name of the variable argv stands for "argument vector". A vector is a one-dimensional array, and argv is a one-dimensional array of strings. Each string is one of the arguments that was passed to the program.

For example, the command line 

gcc -o myprog myprog.c
would result in the following values internal to GCC:


argc
4 
argv[0]
gcc 
argv[1]
-o 
argv[2]
myprog 
argv[3]
myprog.c
